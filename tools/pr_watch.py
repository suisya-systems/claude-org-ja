"""Watch GitHub PR CI checks and emit a journal event when finished.

Cross-platform helper for the secretary role: after creating a PR,
invoke this script to block on ``gh pr checks --watch`` and record a
``ci_completed`` event in ``.state/state.db`` (events table).

Usage::

    py -3 tools/pr_watch.py --pr <PR> [--repo OWNER/REPO] [--interval SEC]

Behavior:

* Resolves the repo via ``gh repo view --json nameWithOwner`` when
  ``--repo`` is omitted.
* Spawns ``gh pr checks <PR> --watch --interval <SEC>`` and forwards
  its stdout/stderr.
* After the watch loop returns, queries
  ``gh pr checks <PR> --json bucket,state,name`` for per-check
  ``bucket`` (gh's documented bucket values are
  ``{pass, fail, pending, skipping, cancel}``) so the journal status
  reflects what CI actually decided rather than just the gh process'
  exit code (gh exits non-zero on a transient watch error too, and
  exit 8 specifically means "Checks pending", not "failed").
  Classifies as ``passed`` (all pass/skipping), ``failed``
  (≥1 fail/cancel), ``incomplete`` (checks parseable but at least one
  still pending / unknown bucket / empty list), ``indeterminate``
  (Issue #685: the ``gh pr checks --json`` probe never returned a
  parseable response within the retry budget, so no CI verdict could
  be read), or ``canceled`` (parent SIGINT). The JSON probe is retried
  with exponential backoff so a transient ``gh`` failure resolves to a
  definitive ``passed`` / ``failed`` instead of degrading; only a
  persistent probe failure lands on ``indeterminate``. Appends one row
  to the ``events`` table in ``<repo_root>/.state/state.db`` (anchored
  to ``tools/..`` so cwd doesn't matter).
* Prints the final status as a single line on stdout and exits with
  a deterministic exit code derived from the *resolved* status
  (Issue #413 / Codex round-1 Major): ``passed``→0, ``failed``→1,
  ``canceled``→2, ``incomplete``→8, ``indeterminate``→8 (Issue #685:
  like ``incomplete`` it is not a clean pass/fail for ``$?`` callers).
  The original ``gh`` exit code
  is intentionally NOT propagated, because the resolver may upgrade
  ``gh exit 8`` ("Checks pending") to a final ``passed`` verdict
  via retry — returning 8 in that case would mislead shell callers
  inspecting ``$?``. The post-CI merge-watch helper may further
  override 0 → 9 on its own failure modes (timeout / no_run /
  helper exception).

M4 (Issue #267): events flow through the SQLite DB only —
``.state/journal.jsonl`` is decommissioned. The recorder uses the same
``StateWriter.append_event`` path as ``tools/journal_append.py``.

The event payload shape is::

    {"event": "ci_completed", "ts": "<ISO8601>",
     "pr": <int>, "repo": "<owner/repo>",
     "status": "passed|failed|incomplete|indeterminate|canceled",
     "duration_sec": <int>, "head": "<short-sha|null>"}

Issue #685: when the verdict was derived from a parseable
``gh pr checks --json`` response, the payload additionally carries
``fail_count`` / ``pending_count`` / ``total_checks`` (so a consumer
can tell a single-check red from a broad outage without re-querying
gh). An ``indeterminate`` verdict instead carries
``retry_recommended: true`` / ``retry_after_sec`` / ``probe_attempts``,
making the retry schedule explicit so the monitoring side can
distinguish "verdict not yet knowable, re-invoke pr_watch" from a
genuinely stalled merge gate. The base keys above are unchanged, so
existing consumers keep working.

Issue #636: ``--merge-watch`` no longer assumes the head is frozen
after CI passes. Each merge-watch iteration polls ``headRefOid`` (via
``gh pr view``); if a new commit lands on the PR branch, the watcher
loops back to ci-watch for the new head and re-emits ``CI_COMPLETED``,
so the secretary never approves a merge against a stale verdict. The
``head`` field (short sha) is added to the ``ci_completed`` event and to
every peer message (``CI_COMPLETED`` / ``PR_MERGED`` /
``PR_MERGED_NO_RUN`` / ``PR_MERGE_WATCH_TIMEOUT``) so callers can tell
which head the signal belongs to.

    blocks until pending checks resolve and then returns 0 (all

    Blocks on ``gh pr checks --watch`` for ``pr``, resolves the final
    verdict, appends a single ``ci_completed`` event and emits one
    ``CI_COMPLETED`` peer message — both tagged with the short head sha
    so the secretary can tell which head the verdict belongs to.
    Returns ``(status, exit_code, head_oid)`` where ``head_oid`` is the
    full head OID observed at verdict time (or ``None``).

    Returns ``("head_changed", 0, head)`` instead when the branch advances
    while we are resolving the verdict (see below); the caller treats that
    like the merge-watch loop-back and re-runs a fresh ci-watch round.

    Head/verdict pairing (Codex review, rounds 1-6): both
    ``gh pr checks --watch`` and ``_resolve_final_status``'s
    ``gh pr checks --json`` observe the PR's *live* head, so a branch that
    advances any time between the start of the watch and the end of
    resolution can yield a verdict describing a different commit than the
    one we tag. We bracket the *entire* watch+resolve phase with a head
    read taken before the watch starts and one taken after the verdict
    resolves: if they differ, we do NOT record a (possibly stale or
    transiently-incomplete) verdict — we return ``head_changed`` so
    :func:`main` restarts the *full* ci-watch (``gh pr checks --watch``
    blocks until the new head's CI actually completes) rather than tagging
    a verdict to a head it doesn't describe or short-circuiting on the
    bounded JSON resolver. When the head is stable across the whole phase,
    the recorded head is exactly the one whose checks the verdict describes.

    Factored out of :func:`main` so the head-poll loop (Issue #636) can
    re-run a fresh ci-watch round — re-emitting ``CI_COMPLETED`` — when the
    head moves, whether observed here (across the watch) or by merge-watch.
